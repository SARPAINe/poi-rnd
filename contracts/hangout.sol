Anti-sybil fuel (ASF) is used to gamify the POI hangouts. Participants can 
use it to "hijack each other's attention", which makes it easier for the 
POI community to keep high standards. Each user gets 5000 "anti-sybil fuel" points, 
and then rewards the other 4 users for their attention. This makes it possible 
for 4 people to put peer-pressure on the 5th if the 5th person isn't focused 
on the joint attention test.
